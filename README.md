### rick
Rust interpreter / compiler

There is an implementation of rule110 in the examples folder, so I can safely state that it's Turing complete.

Very much a work in progress.

## Usage:
If you are running with cargo 
  ```console
  cargo run --release -- examples/hello_world.ric
  ```
otherwise if you are running the executable directly
  ```console
  ./rick <path-to-input-file>
  ```
